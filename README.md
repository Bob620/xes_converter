### How to Run
```
npm -g install xes_converter
xes_converter
```

This program is made to convert SXES output from JEOL software into more usable csv spreadsheets.

More functions, updates, and bug fixes will be rolled out while I'm working at the [UMN Miroprobe Lab](http://probelab.geo.umn.edu)

For more information on the SXES I'm using to test the program, [click here](http://probelab.geo.umn.edu/whatisepma.html#SXESSpectrometer).

Public test datasets might be coming soon?
